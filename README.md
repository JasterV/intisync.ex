# Intisync

Create private sessions to control vibration-based devices remotely

### Notes on the project name

Despite the similarity on the name, this project is not endorsed by [Intiface](https://github.com/intiface) and [Intiface](https://github.com/intiface) is their own registered trademark.

I chose this name because this project was inspired by `Intiface` and the clients require the use of their software to connect the Hub to the bluetooth devices.

Also I find the name IntiSync very catchy and easy to remember.
